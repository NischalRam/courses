What is an ontology in the context of graph databases?


* [ ] A type of graph where nodes are organized into a hierarchy
* [ ] A type of graph that adds properties to nodes and edges
* [*]  A type of graph that adds rules about how nodes and edges can be used
* [ ] A type of graph that has no additional structure

.Solution
====
An ontology is a type of graph that adds rules about how nodes and edges can be used. This allows for more complex queries and reasoning, at the cost of increased complexity in creating and maintaining the ontology.
